          <h3>Heat Shield Rock</h3>
          <p>
            Discovered in January 2005, this was the first meteorite ever
            identified on another planet. Officially named "Meridiani Planum,"
            it is an iron meteorite about the size of a basketball. The
            discovery was significant because it provided direct evidence of
            meteoritic material on Mars, offering clues about the history of
            meteorite impacts on the planet and the composition of materials in
            the solar system.

          <h3>Blueberries on Mars</h3>
          <p>
            The rover discovered small spherical objects, nicknamed
            "blueberries," which are hematite-rich spherules. These provided
            strong evidence that liquid water once flowed on the surface of
            Mars, as they are believed to have formed in wet ground conditions.
